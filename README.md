### To the chosen one,
Our developers are working very hard to deliver the excellent product. 
So, we would like to find something to help them relax by create private chat application with their kik.


Luckily, we found **YOU**, a super star developer who will come to create an application to save our team.
Are you wondering what it is ?  Well, it’s the simple app but powerful.

#### You just need to :
1. Clone this repository and implement code **based on our code**.
2. Display chat history based on data from <a href="#api">API</a>.
3. Please send us a `Pull Requests` when you're finished.
